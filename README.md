# KMS

Mikey-Sakke Key Material generator (RFC 6507, 6508, 6509)

Note! If you are viewing this page on the github web page, there is a wiki link on the right hand side of the project screen that provides more details.

This menu code is not robust and can be broken quite easily. It is just there as a simple example, to show that the underlying Key generation works.

Overview
--------
This code provides a Mikey-Sakke Key cReation/ Management mechanism ptovided via a simple text based menu. This menu code is not robust and can be broken quite easily. It is just there as an simple example, to show that the unerlying Key generation works.


Points to note:

      o It was/ is a personal project. It could do with a serious amount of 
        code review.
        
      o You will also need to clone and build the associated ECCSI-SAKKE
        project in order to build this project. This is because this 
        project uses some of the crypto and data storage code provided
        by the ECCSI-SAKKE crypto library.
        
      o There is no interaction with a clients.
      
      o It is C and OpenSSL (no other maths libraries). As such, this makes 
        it a tad slower, but this should have limited or no effect in the 
        KMS, as these calculation will be done infrequently offline.

Other things to note with this implementation:

      o If you want to turn DEBUG output off, comment out the following line: 
          
            #define ES_OUTPUT_DEBUG
      
        from src/utils/log.h ***in the ECCSI_SAKKE project and rebuild it***.
        
      o If you want to change where data (community and user key data) you 
        will need to modify STORAGE_ROOT in inc/globals.h again ***in the
        ECCSI-SAKKE project and rebuild it***.
       
      o In the make file you need to tell the make script where it can find 
        the ECCSI-SAKKE crypto library files. To do this you modify the 
        __ECCSI_SAKKE_DIR__ attribute in the _make-kms_ file, for example:
       
            ECCSI_SAKKE_DIR=/home/_myname_/ECCSI-SAKKE

Making
------

Prep (linux):
    The make script needs to be executable and as I am new to git hub,
    it does not seem immediately obvious how to (or even if you can) do 
    this. So, when you have cloned the repo, do:

        chmod 775 make

 To make (linux):

    ./make

Note! It is worth having a read of the make file as well. 

Running
-------

To run:

     ./kms

Note! You will need to do the following first before running:
          
          export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<path-to-where-you-installed-ECCSI-SAKKE>/lib
          
refer to make script file for more details.

Doxygen
-------

    For doxygen documentation:

    Install:
        yum install graphviz
        yum install boost-graph
        yum install texlive
        yum install texlive-utils
        yum install doxygen

Then:

     doxygen Doxyfile

Next, web browser and open file:

     file://<path-to-this-dir>/doxygen_output/html/index.html
